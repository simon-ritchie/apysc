# import conventions

The `apysc` library recommends using the `import apysc as ap` to import the package, like the `import numpy as np`, `import pandas as pd`, `import tkinter as tk`, or something like that.

The root package module packages all interfaces you need (for instance, `Sprite`, `Int`, `Stage`).

Also, it packages internal logic modules with the underscore prefix, like the `_file`.

These packages are unnecessary for you.

```py
# runnable
import apysc as ap

ap.Stage()
int_1: ap.Int = ap.Int(10)
number_1: ap.Number = int_1 + ap.Number(10.5)
```
